Stars! do you see them?
-Do you think there will be someone on
the stars staring at the stars like us?
-Yes......
let's make some shooting stars for them.
-Maybe someone will make shooting stars
for us someday.
#Why do the same stars disappear when 
they meet each other?
-Maybe God doesn’t like people who are 
exactly the same.
-Look at those stars, they have various
shapes and colors, forming a colorful
starry sky.
-The same stars will disappear, but no
human will disappear according to this
rule. But we are so similar.
-At this moment, you uniquely occupy this
space in the universe, which is enough
to make you irreplaceable.
#The stars look so hungry for freedom.
-But most of them couldn't escape their
fateful planet even if they tried 
their best.
-You mean the pink planet? Why would
anyone ever want to escape from such
a shining planet.
-Everyone thinks so, except for that
little star.
-But look, it seems to be back again.
#Star, star, who will split into two stars.
-Why does the star split into two when it 
hits a different star?
-Because people don’t like those who are
different from themselves, right?
-Hey, do those stars have souls?
-They may be lying on the surface of the
planet and counting stars just like you.
#Look! shooting stars! Shooting stars from
other planets!
